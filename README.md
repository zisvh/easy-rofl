This is a really quick project I did fast to help begginers or people that have close to 0 coding experience to still be able to get scrims replay files.

## WHAT YOU NEED

- Download VS-Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/ (to edit/write some code ðŸ¤“)
- Download NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ (to make sure your code can start ðŸš€)
- Windows Powershell (terminal to write commands, but you should have it on windows already!)

### INSTALLATION

1) Open this folder in vscode (after downloading it through this page on github)
2) Edit the following lines in your `index.js`:
    - Line 8: `const email = "myemail";` (add your own Bayes Account email)
    - Line 9: `const pass = "mypassword";` (add your own Bayes Account password)
    - Line 10: `const gameID = 28562;` (add your gameID of desired replay that can be found on your bayes dashboard)
3) type `node -v` in your **Powershell** (it should give you back a version of node)
4) get into the `easy-rofl` folder using powershell ([See here for help](https://www.itprotoday.com/powershell/how-use-powershell-navigate-windows-folder-structure)) and type `npm i`. (this should install a few packages needed for our code).


Now let's finally get to launching our script !

## STARTING

Whille still in your folder using **Powershell**, type `node index.js`. This should start the script and give you back a link.
